\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula": a symbolic description of
  the model to be fitted. The first variable on the right-hand-side is a dichotomous treatment indicator (D); 
  the rest of the right-hand-side variables are time-invariant controls (X). If X are time-varying, 
  they will be averaged within each unit based on values specified by \code{X.avg.time}.}
\item{data}{a data frame (must be a balanced panel).}
\item{Y}{outcome.}
\item{D}{treatment.}
\item{X}{time-invariant covariates.}
\item{X.avg.time}{a set of time periods over which covariates are being averaged. Ignored if the treatment starts at different times.}
\item{index}{a two-element string vector specifying the unit (group)
    and time indicators. Must be of length 2.}
\item{Y.match.periods}{a set of pre-treatment time periods in which the outcome variable is being balanced on.}
\item{demean}{a logical flag indicating whether a demeaning procedure will be performed to take out the average of pre-treatment outcomes for each unit.}
\item{kernel}{a logical flag indicating whether the kernel transformation will be used; if \code{kernel = FALSE}, the mean balancing estimator will be used.}
\item{sigma}{a numeric value specifying the bandwidth of the kernel transformation. Ignored if \code{kernel = FALSE}.}
\item{maxnumdims}{a positive integer specifying the maximum number of dimensions to be considered in kernel balancing. See the manual of \code{KBAL} for more details.}
\item{method}{a string that specify the objective function of the balancing algorithm, either "ebal" (entropy balancing) or "el" (empirical likelihood).}
\item{whiten}{a logical flag controlling pre-whitening of the data prior to construction of K. See the manual of \code{KBAL} for more details.}
\item{test}{a logical flag indicating whether cross-validation will be performed to choose sigma, the tuning parameter.}
\item{nsigma}{a positive integer specifying the number of candidate sigmas to be considered in cross-validation.}
\item{print.baltable}{a logical flag that controls whether to print out the balance table after the algorithm is run.}
\item{bootstrap}{a logical flag indicating whether uncertainty estimates will be produced using bootstrap.}
\item{conf.lvl}{a positive number in the range of 0 and 1 specifying confidence levels for uncertainty estimates. The default value is 0.95.}
\item{nboots}{an integer specifying the number of bootstrap runs. Ignored if \code{bootstrap = FALSE}.}
\item{parallel}{a logical flag indicating whether parallel computing will be used in bootstrapping. Ignored if \code{bootstrap = FALSE}.}
\item{cores}{an integer indicating the number of cores to be used in parallel computing. If not specified, the algorithm will use the
  maximum number of logical cores of your computer (warning: this could prevent you from multi-tasking on your computer).}
\item{seed}{an integer that sets the seed in random number generation. Ignored if \code{bootstrap = FALSE}.}

\details{
  \code{tjbal} provides a general reweighting approach to causal inference with time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. It includes two estimators, mean balancing and kernel balancing. The former reweights control units such that the averages of the pre-treatment outcomes and covariates are approximately equal between the treatment and (reweighted) control groups. The latter relaxes the linearity assumption and seeks approximate balance on a kernel-based feature expansion of the pre-treatment outcomes and covariates. The resulting approach inherits the ability of synthetic control and latent factor models to tolerate time-varying confounders, but (1) improves feasibility and stability with reduced user discretion; (2) accommodates both short and long pre-treatment time periods with many or few treated units; and (3) balances on the high-order ``trajectory" of pre-treatment outcomes rather than their period-wise average. We illustrate this method with simulations and two empirical examples.
